## Hello World!
### 2019-12-27
I am Tianyu Li, currently a graphics focus graduate student. I will share my experience about graphics and programming topics via this blog website! Recently, I worked on Ray Tracing, NURBS modeling technique. Next semester, I plan to implement my own realtime renderer in Rust Programming language, which is going to support physics animation, gpu based ray tracing, and pbr based realtime rendering. If you are interested in Rust or graphics topics, you can vist this website on a monthly basis to check my updates. 

This website was designed to be a website with no thirdparty dependency except for Webpack. I implemented every details required by a static blog website. Because it is static, you can not leave a review on web page, I am glad to build contact with you by Email. Feel free to contact me!
