## Hello World!
### 2019-12-27

I am Tianyu Li, a graphics focus graduate student, who will share his thoughts in graphics and programming topics via this blog website! My recent work is mainly about Ray Tracing and Realtime Rendering technique. Next semester, I plan to implement my own realtime renderer in Rust Programming language, which is going to support physics animation, GPU based ray tracing, and PBR based realtime rendering. If you are interested in graphics topics, you can visit this website monthly to check my updates. 

This website was designed to be a website with minimum third-party dependency. I implemented every detail required by a static blog website. Because of its staticity, you can not leave a review on this web page. I am glad to build further contacts with you by Email. Feel free to get in touch with me!
